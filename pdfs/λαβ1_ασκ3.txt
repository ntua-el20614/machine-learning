3.c. Write code to properly convert categorical variables so that the classifiers you will use can handle them.
3.δ. Write code for the scaling of attributes, if you consider it necessary
3.ε. Perform all the previous pre-training step (use transformers) so that the initial set is "clean" to be used for training the classifiers.
3.f. After you have "cleaned" the initial training set, write the appropriate code to generate the sets x and y from the initial training set.
The column 'RainTomorrow' is the value we want our classifier to predict.
3.ζ. Split the dataset into a training set (train set) and a validation set (validation set) (the split to be train set 70% and validation set 30%).
